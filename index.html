    In 2020, Tuguegarao City faced a double typhoon, namely, Goni (‘aka’ Rolly) followed by Vamco (‘aka’ Ulysses) unleashing unprecedented flooding, exposing the Philippines' vulnerability to such disasters. Goni's onslaught, in October, led to severe landslides and overwhelming floods causing the blockage of drainage systems. Vamco, in November, highlighted the inadequacy of the drainage system, unable to handle the severe rain. “The consecutive storms present double trouble for the Philippines’ overcrowded evacuation centers — usually tent setups in gyms and schools — as the coronavirus continues to spread. The country surpassed 402,000 cases this week, the second-highest number in Southeast Asia.” (Cabato, 2020).

</p>
<p class="ex1">
The severe flooding from Typhoons Vamco and Goni in Tuguegarao City emphasised region's susceptibility to climate hazards, emphasising the urgent need for integrated disaster management, climate resilience, and improved preparedness using innovative solutions. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), with their natural drainage tactics, offer an alternative to conventional systems that often lead to high flood risks. 
“SUDS apply natural drainage tactics, unlike most conventional systems, which commonly result in high storm water flows with successive flood risk. To increase catchment response time, they use seminatural such as infiltration trenches, swales, and ponds to delay the flows and minimise flood risks” (Jha, Bloch, & Lamond, 2012). 
 
Apart from flood prevention, SUDS also offer other benefits. This helps to increase water quality, better urban environments, and wildlife habitat preservation as well. These techniques are popularly referred to as SUDS in the UK but also using different labels like BMPS or water-sensitive urban design in respective countries elsewhere. 
 
“SUDS devices are most effective in combination, in the form of a ‘management train’” (Jha, Bloch, & Lamond, 2012) that helps to manage the stormwater in small sub- catchments at low cost. They utilize small, decentralised systems and avoid the large, centralised drainage schemes for exceptional circumstances only. Nevertheless, SUDS design should factor in the probability of groundwater contamination if surface runoff were to pollute water sources used for human consumption. Hence, SUDS provide flexibility, for instance, there are permeable pavement systems that can either allow or prohibit infiltration based on contamination worries.

<h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Vegetated surfaces as SUDS</h3>
</hr>
<p class="ex1">
Vegetated surfaces, including green roofs, street trees, and swales, are greeneries designed to soak, store, and convey stormwater efficiently. These natural solutions not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of their surroundings but also serve as vital tools for mitigating flood risk. By delaying and reducing peak flow, they minimize the chances of urban flooding. Green roofs and swales, for instance, absorb rainwater, reducing runoff and alleviating the strain on drainage systems. Furthermore, these vegetated surfaces aid in stabilizing soil with their roots, preventing erosion. In this way, they play a pivotal role in sustainable urban planning, safeguarding communities from flooding events while contributing to the overall environmental quality.

</p>
<p class="ex1">
“Extensive roof greening on just 10% of the buildings resulted in a runoff reduction of 2.7% for the region and of 54% for the individual buildings. Green roofs can therefore be a useful tool for reducing urban rainfall runoff. Yet in order to provide a greater effect on overall runoff they should be accompanied by other means of runoff reduction and/or water retention” (Mentens, Raes, Hermy, 2005).

<h3 id="pavements"><b>Permeable pavements as SUDS</b></h3>
                </hr>
 <p class="ex1">
Another way of runoff reduction, that can be associated with green roofs, is using permeable pavements. “Permeable paving creates a surface that allows infiltration, either because it is porous, or because specific openings have been provided. The most common applications are for car parks, but lightly trafficked roads and driveways are also suitable” (Jha, Bloch & Lamond, 2012).

</p>
<p class="ex1">
“The permeable pavement can reduce part of surface runoff and flood peak and can delay peak time. The permeable road has better effect on reducing runoff coefficient and flood peak, which can effectively reduce the pressure of urban drainage and reduce the risk of stormwater flood” (Zhu, et al., 2019). Another study conducted in 2018 in China showed positive results. “The results indicated that in 12 scenarios, permeable pavements reduced total surface runoff by 1–40% and peak flow by 7–43%, respectively” (Hu, et al., 2018).

<h3 id="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
                </hr>

<p class="ex1">
Using vegetated surfaced and permeable pavements in Tuguegarao City could have reduced the destructive effect of Typhoons Vamco and Goni that occurred in 2019. The overflows of the drainage systems which occurred during these typhoons would have been avoided had there been vegetation in areas like green roofs and swales capable of absorbing and storing the rains. Their actions could have decreased the peak flow by delay and minimized inundation disaster to the people living in the town. Additionally, pervious pavements would have allowed the rainwater into the soil thereby reducing the surface runoff and aggravation of floods. Combining various SUD options may have led to minimizing the risks associated with floods while also improving water quality as well as overall urban resilience thus greatly reducing the devastating effects of the twin typhoons in Tuguegarao City and its people.
